<p>Consider the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>You have a random variable $X$, which is just a number (or a set of numbers)
that is randomly chosen. In this case, $X$ is a string of n bits (where each bit
is either 0 or 1), and each bit is chosen completely at random.</li>
<li>You also have another random variable $Y$, which is also an n-bit string.
However, $Y$ doesn‚Äôt have to be random in the same way as $X$‚Äîit can follow any
pattern. But $X$ and $Y$ are independent, meaning knowing $Y$ doesn‚Äôt tell us
anything about $X$.</li>
<li>Now, we define a new random variable $Z$ by taking $X$ and $Y$ and combining them
using something called the ‚Äùbitwise XOR operation‚Äù (written as $\oplus$). XOR works
like this for each bit:
‚Äì If the two bits are the same (both 0 or both 1), the result is 0.
‚Äì If the two bits are different (one is 0 and the other is 1), the result
is 1.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, assuming we define $Z = X \oplus Y$, we apply this rule to each bit in the string
separately.</p></p>

                    <p><p>Polynomials are functions of the form:

<li>Can you quickly write down a non-zero polynomial that vanishes at 1, 3 and 100?</li>
<li>Same problem as before, but now with the two extra conditions: $f$ must have

<li>Same problem as before, but now with the following conditions: $f$ must have

<li>Now suppose that we have $n+1$ points $(x_0,y_0), (x_1,y_1), \dots,
(x_n,y_n)$ such that $f(x_i)=y_i$ for $0 \leq i \leq n$. Can you generalize
the above approach to find $f(x)$?</li>

<p>Raibi Jamila, often referred to simply as &ldquo;Raibi,&rdquo; is a beloved yogurt-based
drink that has become a staple in Moroccan culture. Many have tried to
replicate the drink, but none have succeeded in capturing its unique flavor.
The secret recipe for Raibi is known only to a few select individuals, who have
sworn to keep it a secret. To prevent these individuals from sharing the secret
and to ensure it is never lost, we are going to construct a scheme that allows
the secret to be shared among a group of people in such a way that the secret
cannot be revealed unless a minimum number of the group&rsquo;s members act together
to pool their knowledge.</p></p>
